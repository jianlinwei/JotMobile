Welcome to Jot for Android!
===========================

Jot for Android is designed to be a lightweight and versatile app where you can just quickly write something down, and use it as a little virtual notepad.Whether it be reviewing terms for a test, writing down your plan for the day, or if you want to capture any ideas that you may have throughout the day.

Jot is available on many platforms, Windows (Desktop), Mac OSX, and now Android.
We are hoping to make versions for Windows 8 (metro version) and eventually one for iOS.
